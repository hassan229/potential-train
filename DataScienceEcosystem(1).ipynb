    "1.Python: Python is one of the most popular languages for data science due to its simplicity, flexibility, and extensive libraries. Python has a large number of libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn that are widely used for data cleaning, data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.R: R is another popular language for data science, particularly for statistical analysis. R has a vast collection of packages and libraries such as ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr that can be used for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling. R also has a great community support and is used extensively in academia.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.SQL: SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing relational databases. SQL is widely used in data science to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from databases. It is also used for data querying and aggregation, and is an essential skill for any data scientist who works with relational databases.\n",

    "2.Pandas: Pandas is another popular Python library for data science, used for data manipulation, data analysis, and data visualization. Pandas provides easy-to-use data structures such as DataFrame and Series, which can handle tabular data and time-series data. Pandas has a lot of functions for data cleaning, data manipulation, and data aggregation.\n",
